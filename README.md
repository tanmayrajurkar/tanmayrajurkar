# Hi there, I'm Tanmay Rajurkar 👋

## 🚀 About Me
I’m a product-focused builder and startup founder who enjoys working at the intersection of **AI, data, and real-world systems**. I care deeply about understanding user problems, designing decision-driven products, and shipping solutions that operate at scale.

I’m currently a sophomore at **VIT–AP**, with hands-on experience building 0→1 platforms across **GovTech, Infrastructure, FinTech, Healthcare, and Urban Mobility**. I’ve led products end-to-end—from problem framing and user research to system design and deployment—often in fast-paced, high-ambiguity environments.
